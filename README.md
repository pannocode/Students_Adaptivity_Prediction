## Overview
This is a multiclass classification project, which takes input of multiple feature influencing the students adapitibility in Online Education along with the corresposding adaptibility level and predicts the class label for new data.

**Models trained**

    1. Decision Tree
    2. RandomForestClassifier (and Tuned RandomForestClassifier), 
    3. Ada boosting, 
    4. XGBoosting
    5. Gradient Boosting.

**Evaluation Metrics Used**
    
    1. ROC AUC Curve
    2. Classification Reports
        1. Recall
        2. Precision
        3. F1 Score
    3. Accuracy Score


## Motivation and Goal

We all have seen a major shift in education system. Covid has transformed the way of teaching. Now more and more students are studying on Online Medium. With this project we are trying to understand its impact and determine which students are likely to adapt quickly and which are not so likely to.
There are many precussors to it. 

Lets Explore the available data.
